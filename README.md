# hello-world
First github assignment 
Hi my name is chris and I am senior at UCSD. My major is cognitive science with a specialization in machine learning. I find it quite difficult, but I still love it. I find this major really interesting. A fun fact about me is that I love to go on rollercoasters they are so fun.
